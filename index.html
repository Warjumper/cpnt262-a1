  <p class="p">The Clone Wars was a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of
    Independent Systems, which had seceded from the Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the
    clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in
    enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting
    between them swept through the galaxy for nearly four years. The amount of deaths attributed to the Clone Wars is
    estimated to be in the <var id="x">billions</var>, and it lead to the destruction of <var id="y">hundreds</var> of
    worlds.</p>

  <!-- In this equation, x is the billions of dead, y is the number of planets destroyed (each ranging greatly in life on planet), and z is the guessed total losses. -->
